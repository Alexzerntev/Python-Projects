<p>1) Estimate the angle (with respect to the horizontal axis) of the billard cue in image1. To verify your answer, rotate the input image accordingly. The result should be similar to image2.</p>
<p>Hint: Note that the billard cue is the only object with straight edges.</p>
<div>2) Combine image1 and image2 to generate an image similar to image3.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hints:</div>
<div>i) the billard cue is the only object which matched the pattern of a very long horintal line.  </div>
<p>ii) it is very likely that the billard cue is connected with a ball in a binary representation of the image (and it would be useful to separate these objects)  </p>
